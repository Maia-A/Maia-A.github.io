							<h1>Background</h1>					
								<p>Aristotle (c. 384 BCE-322 BCE) was the son of Nichomachus, court physician to the Macedonian king Amyntas II.  
								Both of his parents died when Aristotle was young, so his older sister and her husband became his guardians.  When
								he turned 17, he enrolled in Plato’s Academy in Athens, where he became Plato’s top student.  Born 15 years after
								Socrates’ death, Aristotle’s knowledge of Socrates’ philosophy was directly through Plato. Although Aristotle continued 
								his association with his teacher for 20 years, he did not succeed Plato as director of the academy 
								because he disagreed with some of Plato’s philosophy. Instead, he went back to Macedonia and became the tutor
								of King Phillip II’s son Alexander, who was 13 years old at the time and eventually became Alexander the Great. <p>


								<p>After Alexander became king, Plato went back to Athens and started his own school to rival Plato’s Academy, which 
								was still popular.  At the school, which was known as the Lyceum, Plato enjoyed taking long walks while teaching. People 
								started calling his students “Peripatetics,” which means “those who travel about.” At the Lyceum students learned a variety of
								topics, including math, science, politics, art, and of course, philosophy.</p>
														
							<h1>Philosophy</h1>

								<p>Aristotle’s philosophy influenced ideas of future generations through the Renaissance.  He came up with a theory 
								of deduction based on a logical argument where a conclusion follows from one or more logical premises.  Although he was not
								a scientist, he believed in experimenting with objects in order to find out about them.  He was also the first to classify animals 
								according to their characteristics. In great contrast to Socrates, who wrote nothing, Aristotle wrote 200 books, 31 of which are still widely read today.  These include works on politics, public speaking, logic, science, psychology, and ethics.</p>

							<h1>Later Years and Death</h1>
								<p>When Alexander the Great suddenly died at age 33, he did not leave a successor, and the Macedonian government 
								was overthrown.  The new leadership charged Aristotle with treason because he had been associated with Alexander, but he
								fled to avoid being executed.  Keeping Socrates’ execution in mind, Aristotle decided to flee Athens, "lest the Athenians sin twice against philosophy," as he said, but died a year later of a stomach illness. Although he had been married twice and had a daughter from his first marriage and a son from his second, neither of his children accomplished anything noteworthy. </p>
