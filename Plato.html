							<h1>Background</h1>
							
							<p>Plato (c. 428 BCE–348 BCE) was the son of aristocrats; his father Ariston was descended from the city’s kings and his
							mother Perictione was reported to be related to Solon, a well-known statesman who lived in the 6th century BCE.
							Although his father died when he was young, Plato mentioned his family often in his writings, so he was proud of his heritage. 
							Meeting Socrates was an important part of Plato’s life as a young man. It is said that, upon witnessing Socrates’ questioning technique in 
							the marketplace, he was so impressed that he went home and tore up his poetry.  He became Socrates’ most devoted pupil.</p>

							<p>Plato had considered becoming a politician, but Socrates’ execution changed his mind.  He left Athens for 12 years to travel to Egypt, Italy, and other parts of the Mediterranean. During that time, he studied mathematics, geology, astronomy, and religion and began to write.  His first writings were in the form of a dialogue, in which he explained Socrates’ philosophy.  He went on to write other texts in his own voice and explore his own ideas.  Around 385 BCE, he founded a school known as the Academy, which he led until his death; the Academy lasted for approximately 900 years and is considered to be the first university in the western world.</p>
						
							<h1>Philosophy</h1>

							<p>Plato’s writings cover many interests, including science, mathematics, ethics, and politics.  The <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1497/1497-h/1497-h.htm" 
							target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Republic</i></a>, his best-known work, is written in the format of a dialogue with Socarates and explores justice in government and perfect city-states ruled by philosopher kings.  He is regarded as the founder of western political philosophy, which paved the way for modern democracy.</p>

							<h1>Later Years and Death</h1>
							<p>Plato never married or had children. He continued to work at the Academy until his death when he was in his 80s-- most likely in his sleep from natural causes although some historians claim that he died at a wedding.</p>
