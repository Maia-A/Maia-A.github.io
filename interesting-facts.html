								<h2>Unattractive, Poor, and Married to a Difficult Woman</h2>
								<p>According to Plato, Socrates was a short, stocky man with a snub nose and bulging eyes. 
								He also went out barefoot, dirty, and disheveled. This upset Greeks, who valued beauty 
								and proportion.  Despite his less than ideal appearance, he was married to a woman named 
								Xanthippe, who was more than two decades younger.  Despite her youth, his wife was reported 
								to be physically unattractive and shrewish.  In one account, she emptied a chamber pot in 
								Socrates’ head on a fit of anger!</p>
								<p>According to Plato, Socrates refused payments for tutoring his students and therefore 
								was very poor. Socrates’ Xanthippe was reportedly not happy when Socrates abandoned his 
								earlier profession of stonecutting to become an unpaid philosopher. She complained that he 
								did not make enough money to support his own family.  Socrates did not consider himself 
								a “teacher” because his method involved asking questions, not answering them. He did 
								regard philosophers who were paid to instruct the rich and powerful people of Athens 
								favorably and often made cutting remarks about them.</p>
								<h2>Not his real name?</h2>
								<p>Plato’s name might have been a nickname, since it means “broad and strong.” 
								Some historians believe his real name was Aristocles.  The controversies about him 
								end there. He had some progressive ideas, the most romantic of which was that lovers 
								are incomplete halves until they find each other. He reportedly said that there is 
								“only one person in the world for me, without whom I am lost.”  He believed that truth 
								could be found through mathematics and geometry.  Plato also believed in reincarnation: 
								His theory was that after death, a soul rose to a higher plane through goodness, beauty, 
								and justice.</p>
								<h2>Knew Everything but Knew nothing about equal rights</h2>
								<p>Aristotle contributed to every academic field imaginable, including astronomy, 
								anatomy, geology, geography, meteorology, physics, politics, metaphysics, economics, 
								rhetoric, psychology and theology, literature, poetry, and drama. As a result, he became 
								known as “the man who knew everything.” He has also been called “the last person to know 
								everything there was to know”because he knew everything there was to learn during his 
								lifetime.  Since then, knowledge has grown tremendously, so it’s impossible for anyone 
								else to attain this title.</p>
								<p>However, he believed women were inferior to men and that they did not have the 
								ability to make logical decisions.  He considered women as deceptive, complaining, 
								and impulsive. Since Aristotle was respected at “the” philosopher for many centuries, 
								his misogynistic views were used throughout history to deny the rights of women.  
								To make matters worse, he believed the idea of certain people being “born to be slaves.” 
								He argued that these people did not have “complete souls,” could not think clearly, and 
								needed to be owned in order to live their lives.</p>
