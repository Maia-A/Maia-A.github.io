							<h1>Socrates</h1>
								<blockquote>The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.</blockquote>
								<blockquote>Beware the barrenness of a busy life.</blockquote>
								<blockquote>By all means, marry. If you get a good wife, you’ll become happy; if you get a bad one, you’ll become a philosopher.</blockquote>
								<blockquote>I decided that it was not wisdom that enabled poets to write their poetry, but a kind of instinct or inspiration, such as you find in seers and prophets who deliver all their sublime messages without knowing in the least what they mean.</blockquote>
								<blockquote>Be as you wish to seem.</blockquote>
								<blockquote> To know, is to know that you know nothing. That is the meaning of true knowledge.</blockquote>
								<blockquote>He is richest who is content with the least, for content is the wealth of nature. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us.</blockquote>
								<blockquote>The unexamined life is not worth living.</blockquote>
								<blockquote>There is only one good, knowledge, and one evil, ignorance. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Wonder is the beginning of wisdom. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>To find yourself, think for yourself. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Strong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss people. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Be slow to fall into friendship, but when you are in, continue firm and constant. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>He who is not contented with what he has, would not be contented with what he would like to have. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Death may be the greatest of all human blessings. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>If all misfortunes were laid in one common heap from which everyone must take an equal portion, most people would be contented to take their own and depart. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Once made equal to man, woman becomes his superior. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>The way to gain a good reputation is to endeavor to be what you desire to appear. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>People demand freedom of speech to make up for the freedom of thought which they avoid. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>When the debate is over, slander becomes the tool of the loser. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>The hottest love has the coldest end. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>From the deepest desires often come the deadliest hate. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Contentment is natural wealth, luxury is artificial poverty. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Call no man unhappy until he is married. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Let him that would move the world, first move himself. </blockquote>
							<h1>Plato</h1>					
								<blockquote>There are two things a person should never be angry at, what they can help, and what they cannot. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>He who is not a good servant will not be a good master. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Science is nothing but perception. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Never discourage anyone... who continually makes progress, no matter how slow. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Life must be lived as play. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>People are like dirt. They can either nourish you and help you grow as a person or they can stunt your growth and make you wilt and die. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Only the dead have seen the end of war. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Plato is my friend, but Truth is a better friend.</blockquote>
								<blockquote>No one ever teaches well who wants to teach, or governs well who wants to govern. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>If a man neglects education, he walks lame to the end of his life. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Love is a serious mental disease. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Courage is knowing what not to fear. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>As empty vessels make the loudest sound, so they that have least with are the greatest babblers. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>I have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of reasoning. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>The greatest wealth is to live content with little. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>There is truth in wine and children. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Good actions give strength to ourselves and inspire good actions in others. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>False words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Good people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly, while bad people will find a way around the law. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>A good decision is based on knowledge and not on numbers. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by inferiors. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself; to be conquered by yourself is of all things most shameful and vile. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>There is no harm in repeating a good thing. </blockquote>
								<blockquote>Knowledge is true opinion. </blockquote>
