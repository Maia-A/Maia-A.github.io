							<h1>Background</h1>
							<p>Socrates (c. 470 BCE-399 BCE) was the son of Sophroniscus, an Athenian stonemason 
							and sculptor, and worked as a mason for many years before becoming a philosopher.  
							He was also a citizen soldier who served during the Peloponnesian Wars. Socrates married 
							a much younger woman named Xanthippe and had three sons.  He did not have a cordial relationship 
							with his wife and none of his sons followed in his footsteps.</p>
							<h1>Philosophy</h1>

							<p>Socrates believed that wisdom comes from knowing oneself.  The application of this belief 
							to politics implies that the best rulers are the people who have the greatest knowledge, 
							ability, and morals.  He emphasized the importance of the mind over physical beauty. 
							He did not enjoy lecturing.  Instead, he preferred going to the marketplace to apply 
							his questioning technique, which we now know as the “Socratic Method.” Through a series 
							of questions, he could make anyone’s false logic break down.  However, he never 
							claimed to have the right answer.  His goal was to dissolve ignorance through the process.</p>

							<p>Socrates never wrote any of his own accounts.  It was his student Plato who wrote dialogues 
							in the format of plays with Socrates having a speaking part.  In the dialogues, Socrates is humble 
							and quick-witted. Other writers did not paint a flattering picture of Socrates.  For example, 
							the playwright Aristophanes' portrayal of Socrates as a character in his comedy play “Clouds” 
							was one of an unkempt individual whose goal was to corrupt the minds of young people.</p>

							<h1>Trial and Death</h1>
							<p>Although Athenians appreciated Socrates’ philosophy, some felt he threatened their 
							established way of life. In 399 BCE, he was brought to court for heresy and corrupting 
							the youth of Athens.  He defended himself, but the jury convicted him. In fact, Socrates 
							blamed Aristophanes’ warped accounts for causing his people to judge him unfairly.  His 
							sentence was death by ingesting a poison called hemlock. He did have a chance to escape 
							by bribing the guards but chose to stay and be executed, saying that he wasn’t afraid 
							of death.</p>
